- Movie Search
  - Problem: Search lots of movies fast.
  - Solution: Search in database, save in cache.
  - Trade-off: Cache is quick but needs space.
  - Mistake: Forgot to say cache type (should be Redis).

- Recommendations
  - Problem: Suggest movies to users.
  - Solution: Match genres at night, save in movies.
  - Trade-off: Night job is fast but old data.
  - Mistake: Said movies (should be Recommendations).

- Notifications
  - Problem: Send messages to users.
  - Solution: Queue messages, send push.
  - Trade-off: Queue is safe but slow.
  - Mistake: Forgot email notifications.

- Reviews
  - Problem: Update rating_avg quick.
  - Solution: Update when review added.
  - Trade-off: Fast update slows database.
  - Mistake: Said rating_avg (should be avg_rating).
